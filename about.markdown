I am an assistant professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &
Engineering at the University of Washington.  I was previously an assistant
professor in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech. Prior to starting
as faculty, I was fortunate to be hosted
by <a href="http://cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns">Michael
Kearns</a>, <a href="http://cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth">Aaron Roth</a>,
and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/quaerereverum9/"> Rakesh Vohra </a>
as a Warren Center fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. I completed my PhD
working with <a href="http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~avrim/"> Avrim Blum </a> at
Carnegie Mellon University.

I study the social impact of machine learning and
the impact of social behavior on ML's guarantees. How should machine learning be
made robust to behavior of the people generating training or test data for it?
How should ensure that the models we design do not exacerbate inequalities
already present in society?
